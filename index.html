<h1>Mighty Narrative Pitch</h1>

<p>Hi Norma, we wanted to pitch you some ideas for the narrative style of the show,
the main goal is for us to keep it top notch and at the same time have everything fit into the budget.
I think a really big part of that is to use our resources wisely, sketch out the entire season and key moments with you so that
we can distribute our time and efforts where they’re needed the most. Here’s a couple of suggestions and references that we think will work with the wonderful universe you’ve created.</p>

<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>Brenda La Brujita it’s a show that’s primarily about the relationship between Brenda, her family and her friends.
As shown in the pilot, the series is going to show a lot of interactions between them.
We believe that Dragon Prince does a great job of keeping their conversations tight, neat and effective.
Mostly done in open shots with interesting compositions that take advantage of the foreground and background.</p>



<p>The conversations are usually kept in a few shots, doing simple movements and introducing new elements to make the shots dynamic and interesting.
Taking advantage of different planes of visual composition.</p>

<p>All conversations are usually only interrupted by inserts that help to advance the story and give us new information and help advance the story.</p>

<h2>Comedy</h2>
<p>We can have a lot of fun with the juxtaposition of visual comedy and an interesting pasing. We feel that Brenda has a
lot of fun characters that can have a lot of funny moments. We don’t need to spotlight these moments as an almost “blink and miss” approach can add a lot of dynamism and keep the story going.</p>

COMEDY1

<p>Acting is everything and expressions can tell a lot about the personalities of our characters as well as have
truly funny and heartwarming interactions. Not everything can and has to be expressed by dialogue. </p>

COMEDY4

COMEDY2

<p>Following the idea of different planes of visual composition, this can also be used for comedic effect and visual punchlines.</p>

COMEDY3

<h2>Anticipation</h2>
<p>Sometimes anticipation can be very powerful, and when we’re trying to be effective with our resources we can
tell a lot by showing very little and building a lot of anticipation.</p>

ANTICIPATION2

<p>Again, Dragon Prince does it in a very effective way.</p>

ANTICIPATION1

<h2>Fighting</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of magic in the show, there’s probably going to be a few physical confrontations.
We think we can use cinematic language to solve most of the magic fighting. Splicing movement in the most interesting
angles and keeping an upbeat rhythm choosing to cut to something more interesting than to have an expansive world-turning shot.</p>

FIGHT1

<p>Sometimes suggesting a grand scale fight just outside the frame can help with the scope of things. Moving backgrounds and focus changes.</p>

FIGHT2

FIGHT3

FIGHT4

<p>Magic can be shown in a lot of different ways, sometimes even just a background change in the middle of a montage can be very powerful.</p>

FIGHT6

FIGHT7

FIGHT8

<p>And then, on the very special moments, when Brenda is at the most critical part of her journey, then we can go all out on
a couple of shots to make those moments really stand out.</p>

FIGHT5

<h2>Visuals</h2>
<p>Lastly, we need to be very strategic with visuals and the use of VFX. To not overwhelm the audience we can use strategic,
effective and meaningful effects that don’t strive to be flashy but want to be symbolic. Obviously the won’t look as simple as ATLA’s but they will echo the design and purpose of those powers.</p>
